# Abstract
st.subheader("Abstract")
st.write(
    "Sign language is one of the oldest and most natural forms of communication. "
    "However, since most people do not know sign language and interpreters are scarce, "
    "GSSTC provides a real-time method using machine learning for fingerspelling-based "
    "American Sign Language recognition. The system processes hand gestures through "
    "MediaPipe for landmark detection, followed by classification using a Random Forest model. "
    "This ensures efficient and accurate gesture recognition, bridging the communication gap."
)

# Introduction
st.subheader("Introduction")
st.write(
    "American Sign Language (ASL) is widely used for communication by the Deaf and Mute (D&M) community. "
    "However, a significant barrier exists as most people do not understand ASL. "
    "This project introduces an AI-powered solution to convert sign gestures into text, "
    "making communication seamless and inclusive."
)

# Motivation
st.subheader("Motivation")
st.write(
    "D&M individuals rely on sign language to communicate, but since many people do not understand ASL, "
    "this creates a communication gap. The goal of GSSTC is to develop a vision-based system "
    "that translates ASL into readable text, allowing effective interaction between ASL users "
    "and non-ASL speakers."

# Model Used
st.subheader("Model Used")
st.write(
    "GSSTC utilizes **MediaPipe Hands** for precise hand tracking and landmark extraction. "
    "These extracted landmarks are then processed using a **Random Forest Classifier**, "
    "a robust machine learning model capable of distinguishing between different sign gestures "
    "based on key features such as angles and distances between hand landmarks."
)

# Developer Credits
st.subheader("Built with Passion")
st.write(
    "Developed and Designed by IITians as a Software Engineering Lab project. "
    "This project is a step towards making ASL more approachable for everyone."
